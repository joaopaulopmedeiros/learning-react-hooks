## What is a Hook? 
> A Hook is a special function that allows you to use React resources. For example, useState is a Hook 
> that allows you to add the React state to a function component. We will learn other Hooks later. - ReactJS documentation

## When should I use a Hook? 
> If you write a function component and realize that you need to add some state to it, previously you 
> had to convert it to a class. You can now use a Hook within an existing function component. Let's do 
> it right now! - ReactJS documentation

## useState
- It is a way to preserve values.
- It declares a state variable.
- It is a new way to use the same capabilities that this.state has in a class components.
